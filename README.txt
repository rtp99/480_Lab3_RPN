This program should be run in the command line.
Input may be entered when a > symbol is present.
Conclude your statement by pressing enter.
Spaces are ignored. Whitespace is for the user's benefit alone, a computer does not need it.
Example: 6+4+log5 is equivalent to 6 + 4 + log 5
Because the command line cannot process subscript, "log base 10" is shortened to "log".
The spec sheet only specified that log base 10 and e (ln) were necessary, hence the shortening
Example: log6 will give you the log base 10 of 6
Parenthesis are optional for functions (trig functions, log functions) but will help establish the operand better.
Example: tan 6 + 4 will give you the tangent of 6 and then add 4. this is because functions take precedence.
Example: tan(6+4) will give you the tangent of 6+4 or more accurately the tangent of 10.
Functions effectively hold the same level of precedence as a parenthesis.
